    "### Background \n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, scientists at PNNL have developed a new class of fully synthetic sequence defined polymers based on nucleophilic aromatic substitution chemistry of triazine reagents.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<h3 align=\"center\">Triazine monomers</h3>\n",
    "![Triazine](./Picture2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, simulations at PNNL have examined single molecules or pairs of molecules in the simulation box, or, at most, pairs of dimers in the box. While these reveal motifs of noncovalent interactions, and the possibility of forming nanorods from folded monomers or paired molecules in dimers, they do not reveal ensemble behavior.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "- To simulate the ensemble behavior of all possible oligomers within the set that contains up to four different side chains on oligomers that are ideally tetramers. \n",
    "- The ensemble could be up to 300 oligomers in a box. \n",
    "- To make simulations computationally feasible, I will develop a coarse graining method for triazine based polymers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What have I even done?\n",

    "\n",
    "I measured all the bond lengths, angles and dihedral distributions of the CGed atomistic trajectory. Then I started with an equilibrated CG PEG structure and ran a simulation on the structure with guess for each of the parameters.\n",
